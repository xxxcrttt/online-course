### Intro to Machine Learning 

#### ML Definition: 
* Arthur Samuel(1959):
Fields of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicity programmed. 
* Tom Mitchell(1998): 
Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to *learn* from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, 
if its performance on T, as measured by P, improved with experience E. 

Example: SPAM 
* T: Classifying emails as spam or not spam
* E: Watching you label emails as spam or not spam
* P: The number(or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/ not spam

种类: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Recommender systems 

#### Supervised Learning
* Regression: Predict continuous valued output 
* Classification: Discrete valued output(0 or 1)

#### Unsupervised Learning 
* Clusters 
* Segmentation
